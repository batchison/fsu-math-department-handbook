        <title>A Word to the Mathematics Major</title>
        <p>
            The Mathematics Department would like to welcome you as one of our majors. This planning guide is intended to help you in selecting your courses in their proper sequence and to give you direction in your overall program of study. You are not alone in this process. Although you are primarily responsible for your schedule, you will be assigned an advisor who can help answer questions you may have about the program and course selections. It is important to keep in mind that not all courses are offered every semester and some upper level courses are only offered on alternate years. It is also important to be sure you have satisfied the prerequisites for each course.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top graduating senior mathematics major with a G.P.A. above 3.5 in mathematics is awarded the Frank Castagna Award for Excellence in Mathematics. There are other awards possible within the Department and the University.
        </p>
        <p>
            The faculty is here to help you with any questions you may have. It is our hope that you will have a successful and rewarding experience at Framingham State University.
        </p>

            Congratulations on your choice of school and major.

        <title>Mission</title>
        <p>
            The mission of the Mathematics Department is twofold. Firstly, we provide a strong, broadbased preparation in mathematics and its related skills to enable the student to select a variety of career paths in which the knowledge and intellectual skills of mathematics can be used. Secondly, we function as a service department to other programs on the campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goals of the mathematics curriculum for the mathematics major will develop, in the student, competencies in analysis, algebra, probability and statistics, number theory, geometry, technology, and the history and applications of mathematics. It will also develop and enhance such relevant abilities as critical thinking, logical reasoning, problem solving, including intuition and rigor, modeling, and oral and written communication skills in mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The combination of the mathematics curriculum and general education portion of the University curriculum is such that the career paths open to the student are broad and varied from teaching, actuarial science, statistics, graduate studies, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to carry out its mission, the Mathematics Department strives to meet the needs of a diverse campus and student body through periodic assessment of its course and program offerings. The faculty is committed to developing and improving students’ problem solving and reasoning skills, as well as their mathematical knowledge, in order to prepare them to face the challenges of the twenty-first century. The department will continue to offer programs to meet the ever-changing needs of the students and the nation. Our continuing goal is the achievement of excellence and scholarship by all our students.
